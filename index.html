    <h2>What is This bootcamp about?</h2>
    <p>


Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful learning paradigm of machine learning (ML). Reinforcement Learning (RL) is at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, powering advancements in robotics, autonomous systems, game playing, and decision-making algorithms. Mastering RL opens up a world of opportunities in both research and industry, enabling you to contribute to groundbreaking innovations.

    <p>
Capturing your control problem as a meaningful Markov Decision Process (MDP) is not trivial. Additional challenges arise in the training in terms of stability and evaluation. Other practical aspects include reproducibility, efficiency, implementation, deployment in hardware, or choosing the most suitable algorithm for your problem.

RL applications in particle accelerators are very promising, but have been deployed in real machines only a handful of times. This workshop aims at lowering the barrier in applying RL and making it a more widely used tool.RL applications in particle accelerators are very promising, but have been deployed in real machines only a handful of times.
